# Del's Kaomoji Matrix Project 

I designed this project with the porpose of creating not only a cool outfit for the music festival [Second Sky](https://www.secondskyfest.com), but to create a skeleton that was scalable for future projects that provides rapid prototyping and even more rapid development, found [here](https://github.com/DelToney/LedMatrixBase). This was also a way for [s4r4htonin](https://github.com/s4r4htonin) and I to express ourselves and create something together!

## Platform

This project utilizes the mobility and flexibility of the PlatformIO platform as well as being powered by the FastLed library
